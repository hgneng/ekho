# pico output module is based on the generic plugin for Speech
# Dispatcher. It means there is no code written explicitly for
# this plugin, all the specifics are handled in this configuration
# and we call a simple command line client to perform the actual
# synthesis. Use this config file with the sd_generic output module.
#
# IMPORTANT: The audio output method relies on an audio playback
# utility (play, aplay, paplay for OSS, ALSA or Pulse)
# being installed. If this is not the case, consider installing it
# or replace the $PLAY_COMMAND string in the GenericExecuteString below
# with play, paplay or similar.
#
# GenericExecuteSynth is the shell command that should be
# executed in order to say some message. This command must
# stop saying the message on SIGKILL, otherwise it's useless.
# You can use the variables $LANGUAGE, $VOICE, $PITCH and $RATE
# which will be substituted for the appropriate value (you
# can modify this value, see other parameters).
# The command can be split into more lines, if necessary, using '\'.

# The following three items control punctuation levels None, Some, and All.
# Each of these values will be substituted into the $PUNCT variable depending
# on the value passed to speech dispatcher from applications.
# Note that if an empty string is specified, then $PUNCT will be blank 
# which is a default situation for espeak.

# order not to be badly handled by the output module or misinterpreted
# by shell.

# If the language you need to pass in $LANG is different
# from the standard ISO language code, you can specify
# which string to use instead. If you wish to use
# other than ISO charset for the specified language,
# you can add it's name (as accepted by iconv) as a
# third parameter in doublequotes.
