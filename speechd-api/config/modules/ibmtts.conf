# -- SSML Support --

# Some version of IBM TTS support SSML. If IbmttsUseSSML
# is set to 1, SSML will be used and advanced features like
# index marking will be working. If set to 0, all SSML is
# deleted from the message prior to sending it to IBM TTS.
# By default, SSML support is switched on.

# IbmttsUseSSML 1

# -- Abbreviation dictionaries --

# Enable the abbreviation dictionaries.

IbmttsUseAbbreviation 1

# -- SOUND ICONS --

# IBM TTS Synthesizer does not currently support sound icons
# (audio files that are played by name when an application requests
# a sound icon).  If you have installed the free(b)soft sound-icons
# package, this is the directory where will they be found.  If not
# blank, the IBM TTS Output Module will play them if it finds a
# file whose name matches the sound icon name.  If blank, or no
# matching file is found, the name of the sound icon will be spoken.

#IbmttsSoundIconFolder "/usr/share/sounds/sound-icons/"

# -- DEBUG --

# Debug turns debugging on or off
# See speechd.conf for information where debugging information is stored.

# TODO: Change this to 0 and comment out for final release.

Debug 0

# DebugFile specifies the file where the debugging information
# should be stored (note that the log is overwritten each time
# the module starts)

# DebugFile "/tmp/debug-ibmtts"

# -- VOICE PARAMETERS --

# This table provides a mechanism for fine-tuning the voices used for synthesis.
# The dialect is chosen by the table above, then adjusted according to these parameters.
# The columns are:
#   Voice Name   - See the Speech Dispatcher manual for standard voice names.  Use lowercase names.
#   M/F          - Gender.   0 = male. 1 = female.
#   Br           - Breathiness.  0 to 100. 0 is usually used for males, 40 or 50 for females.
#   Hd Sz        - Head Size.  0 to 100.
#   Pitch Bas    - Pitch Baseline.  0 to 100.
#   Pitch Flc    - Pitch Fluctuation.  0 to 100.
#   Rough        - Roughness.  0 to 100
#   Speed        - Rate.  0 to 100.

# Volume is controlled via speechd.conf or SSIP commands.

# Application RATE or PITCH commands are relative to the settings here.
# For example, if Pitch Bas is 80 below, a PITCH command of -50 would set the
# pitch baseline to halfway between 80 and 0, or 40.

# All columns must be provided.

# male2             Adult Male 2

# female1           Adult Female 1
# female2           Adult Female 2

# -- KEY NAME SUBSTITUTIONS --

# Maps Speech Dispatcher key names used in SSIP KEY commands to speakable words.
# The string in the "SD Key" column occurring anywhere in a KEY command
# is replaced with the string in "Spoken".  The substitutions occur in the
# order listed.  "Lang" determines which language the substitution applies
# to.
