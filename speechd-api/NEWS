Version 0.7.1
 * Easy configuration of the client communication method using a
   single environment variable SPEECHD_ADDRESS.
 * Advanced autospawn -- server is autostarted only when its
   communication channel matches the communication channels requested
   by the client.  Local server is not started when client attempts to
   connect to a remote server.
 * Both libspeechd and python library now report a detailed error
   information in case of connection failure (why has connect failed,
   why was it not possible to autostart the server, what has the
   server reported etc.)  Clients can directly show this information
   to the user and the user doesn't have to search them in logfiles.
 * Improvements in memmory usage
 * Cleanup of priorities of messages in logging output
 * Various bugfixes, cleanups and fine-tunnings

Version 0.7
 * Speech Dispatcher uses UNIX style sockets as default means of communication,
   thus avoiding the necessity to choose a numeric port and greatly easying
   session integration
 * Autospawn -- server is started automatically when a client requests it
   It can be forbidden in the appropriate server configuration file
   (thanks to Luke Yelavich)
 * Pulse Audio output reworked and fixed (thanks to Bill Cox and Rui Batista)
 * Dispatcher runs as user service (not system service) by default
   and doesn't require the previous presence of ~/.speech-dispatcher
   directory
 * All logging is now managed centrally, not by separate options
   (thanks to Luke Yelavich)
 * Graceful audio fallback (e.g. if pulse is not working, use Alsa...)
   (thanks to Luke Yelavich)
 * Audio output to different soundsystems through the
   libao library (thanks to Marco Skambraks)
 * Various bugfixes and fine-tunnings
 * Updated documentation

Version 0.6.7
 * Central settings for prefered audio output method
 * Dummy output module gives a pre-recorded message whenever
   no other output module works   
 * Possibility to switch on verbose logging over SSIP
   for easy debugging and bug-reporting from client applications
 * 'spd-conf' configuration, diagnostics and troubleshooting tool
 * Volume settings in Pulse Audio
 * Pulseaudio output now keeps connection to daemon open.

   and for Cepstral Swift.

Version 0.2
 * Improved documentation (definition of the SSIP
   protocol is now a separated document)
 * Caching of characters, keys and sound icons in the
   Festival output modules brings much quicker responses
   for these types of events.
 * If some output module fails to load completely (e.g. because
   it's unable to connect to the synthesizer), error is reported
   to Speech Dispatcher and written into the log file. (Sadly,
   this doesn't work with kernels that don't support real threading).
 * Necessary recoding in Festival output module is now retrieved
   from Festival itself.

Version 0.1
