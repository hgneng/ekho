@ Hi, this is a basic Speech Dispatcher test.

@ I've successfully connected to the server

@ and priority for the messages.

You have to run as fast as you can just to stay where you are.
If you want to get anywhere, you'll have to run much faster.

@ If the tests did what was expected, your installation of Speech Dispatcher
@ probably works fine. If not, there can be different causes, see
@ the documentation -- Troubleshooting. (Note that some synthesizers
@ don't have to support setting of the voice parameters. If everything
@ else worked correctly, this is not a fatal problem.).
