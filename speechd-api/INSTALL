The requirements:
=================

You will need these components to compile Speech Dispatcher:  
 - glib 2.0  (http://www.gtk.org)
 - libdotconf 1.0 (http://www.azzit.de/dotconf/)
 - pthreads
 - gcc and GNU make (http://www.gnu.org)
 - festival-freebsoft-utils 0.3+ (optional)
	(http://www.freebsoft.org/festival-freebsoft-utils)

Only if you are building from Git, you also need these:
 - automake 1.7+, autoconf, pkg-config and libtool

We recommend to also install these packages:
 - PulseAudio (http://www.pulseaudio.org)
 - Festival (http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/)
 - Espeak (http://espeak.sourceforge.net/)

These packages are known to work with Speech Dispatcher:
 Software synthesizers:
 - Festival (http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/) -- an extensible
     speech synthesis engine with support for various languages (English,
     Spanish, Italian, Finnish, Czech, Russian, Hindi, some African languages
     and others)
 - Espeak (http://espeak.sourceforge.net/) -- a light and fast multi-lingual
     synthesizer with very good support for various Speech Dispatcher
     features.
 - Flite, Cicero, IBM TTS, Dectalk Software, Ivona
 - Pulse Audio (http://www.pulseaudio.org/)

 User applications:
 - Orca (http://www.gnome.org/projects/orca/) -- AT-SPI screen reader (Gnome)
 - speechd-el (http://www.freebsoft.org/) -- Emacs speech interface
 - Linux Screen Reader (LSR (http://live.gnome.org/LSR)
 - gnome-speech/Gnopernicus (http://www.gnome.org/)
 - BrlTTY (http://mielke.cc/brltty/)
 - ...

Building Speech Dispatcher:
===========================

(for instructions about how to build from Git or Git snapshot see bellow)

If you want to use Speech Dispatcher with Festival (recommended), you
also need to install festival-freebsoft-utils version 0.3 or higher!

If you want to use Speech Dispatcher with Ivona, you need to install
libdumbtts

To compile the whole project, including Speech Dispatcher server, all modules
and clients, simply extract the distribution archive and change to 
speech-dispatcher-<version> directory and run "make all" command as follows:

 $ tar -xzvf speech-dispatcher-0.7.1.tar.gz
 $ cd speech-dispatcher-0.7.1


Notes about ALSA, Pulse, OSS and NAS support
============================================

Speech Dispatcher's default audio output system is the Pulse Audio
with an automatic fallback on ALSA if Pulse is not available.
It's also possible possible to use libao output and to build
Speech Dispatcher with Network Audio System and/or OSS support
and then switch between these two audio systems in the configuration
files (speechd.conf).

Notes about Espeak support
==========================

You need to install Espeak libraries to be able to use the native
output module. Some distributions like debian provide
those libraries in a different package (libespeak1 and libespeak-dev).

Notes about Flite support
=========================

You don't need to do anything special to compile Speech Dispatcher
with Flite support, Flite will be detected automatically when running
./configure. However, make sure that you have correctly installed
flite libraries and examine the output of ./configure carefully.

You should have configured flite with
    ./configure --enable-shared
to be able to use the flite plug-in. If you aren't sure if you have done this,
check for example for libflite_cmu_us_kal.so in your library directory.
(It's also possible to use Speech Dispatcher with Flite static libraries,
but it is generally not a good way unless you know what you are doing.)

Notes about IBM TTS support
===========================

In order to build the propriatary (non-free software) ibmtts output
module, you will need one of two things:

  1.  An install of the proprietary commercial IBM TTS synthesizer (for Linux),
or

  2.  The sdk for IBM TTS, which contains the headers and a "stub library" for
      linking against. This SDK is Free Software and freely available, however
      it doesn't contain the synthesizer. It will enable you to build the
      module, but this module will give you no sound until you install the
      synthesizer itself.

The sdk can be obtained here:

      http://ibmtts-sdk.sourceforge.net/

      It isn't obvious on that website, but you download the sdk using cvs:

      cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@ibmtts-sdk.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ibmtts-sdk login 

      cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@ibmtts-sdk.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ibmtts-sdk co sdk

      The sdk is licensed using a BSD-style license.

You will also need libsndfile in order to enable sound icon emulation with the
ibmtts output module.  (As of Apr 2006, the Debian packages you need are
libsndfile1 and libsndfile1-dev.)

Continue building Speech Dispatcher
===================================

On some systems, before running make, you have to set the environment variable
SED to your binary of the sed application. This is usually done as:

$ export SED=sed

$ ./configure
$ make all

If everything worked ok, you can install all the parts to the default
path by running (as root):

 $ make install

If it doesn't work, please see "Building from CVS" if this is your case. If
not, you can ask us on users@lists.freebsoft.org or report possible bugs on
speechd@bugs.freebsoft.org .

Building from Git
=================

If you are building directly from Git or from some Git tarball snapshot, you
must first create the ./configure file. Please make sure you have all the
necessary tools listed in the requirements at the beginning of this README
in their appropriate versions. Automake and autoconf are especially version
sensitive.

Then please do:

 $ cd speech-dispatcher # where speech-dispatcher is your Git clone
 $ ./build.sh

Now the configure file should be created and you can proceed like with
an ordinary instalation.

Installing Festival Speech Dispatcher interface:
================================================

You need to install the new version of festival-freebsoft-utils (0.3
or higher).

Please make sure that Festival server_access_list configuration
variable and your /etc/hosts.conf are set properly. server_access_list
must contain the symbolic name of your machine and this name must be
defined in /etc/hosts.conf and point to your IP address. You can test
if this is set correctly by trying to connect to the port Festival
server is running on via an ordinary telnet. If you are not rejected,
it probably works.

Example of the server_access_list configuration line
in festival.scm:
(set! server_access_list '("127.0.0.1" "localhost" "chopin"))

Testing
=======

You can try to execute Speech Dispatcher by
 $ speech-dispatcher

If Speech Dispatcher is running, you can test if it's working by:
 (on some other console)
 $ cd speech-dispatcher-0.7.1/src/tests
 $ ./run_test basic.test
(You can also try other tests, if you like.)

Also try
 $ speech-dispatcher --help
to see how you can run it as a standalone program and possibly see
what's wrong.

Troubleshooting
===============

If you think something is missing, try additionally:

 $ mkdir PREFIX/etc/speech-dispatcher
 $ cp -r config PREFIX/etc/speech-dispatcher
 $ mkdir PREFIX/include
 $ cp clients/libspeechd.h PREFIX/include/

where PREFIX is your installation path prefix (defaulting to /usr/local).

Building in more detail:
========================

The hierarchy of Makefiles is used to build each of the parts. The top
level Makefile allows you to compile some extra parts of the project.
These are:

    - doc ........ build documentation in all supported formats
                   (see doc/README for more information)
    - src/server ..... build speachd server - this is the same as
                   cd src/server; make all
    - src/modules .... build all speachd modules - this is the same as
                   cd src/modules; make all
    - src/clients .... build all clients - this is the same as
                   cd src/clients; make all
    - clean ...... remove all files except the sources (does not
                   clean documentation)
    - all ........ build server, modules and clients

If you are building directly from CVS or from some CVS tarball snapshot, you
must first create the ./configure file. Please make sure you have all the
necessary tools listed in the requirements at the beginning of this README
in their appropriate versions. Automake and autoconf are especially version
sensitive.

Then please do:

 $ cd speech-dispatcher-0.7.1
 $ ./build.sh

Now the configure file should be created and you can proceed like with
an ordinary instalation.
