<!--
	MIDI XML is an XML representation of standard MIDI files for
	MIDI 1.0. Unlike standard MIDI files, it can have timestamps
	present as either absolute or delta values. This makes it
	convenient as an intermediate format to convert from the
	MusicXML format and other formats where note on and note off
	are not represented as discrete events. To convert to
	Standard MIDI Files, delta values must be used.
	
	Suggested use:

	For Standard MIDI Files, channels are required; events
	are not rechannelized.

	The MMA MIDI DTD contains the definitions of all MIDI

	For convenience, we include a local copy with our
