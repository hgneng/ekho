<!--
	An opus collects MusicXML scores together into a larger
	entity. The individual scores could be movements in a
	symphony, scenes or acts in an opera, or songs in an
	album. The opus definition allows arbitrary nesting
	either via an opus (included in the document) or an
	opus-link (linked like scores). Future versions of the
	MusicXML format may expand this DTD to include reference
	data and other metadata related to musical scores.
	
	Suggested use:
	
	<!DOCTYPE opus PUBLIC

<!-- Component DTD modules -->

<!--
	The common DTD module contains the entities and elements
	that are shared among multiple DTD modules.
-->
<!ENTITY % common PUBLIC
	"-//Recordare//ELEMENTS MusicXML 3.0 Common//EN"
	"common.mod">
%common;

<!--
	The link DTD module contains XLink attributes.
-->
<!ENTITY % link PUBLIC
	"-//Recordare//ELEMENTS MusicXML 3.0 Link//EN"
	"link.mod">
%link;

<!-- Elements -->

<!--
	Opus is the document element. The document-attributes
	entity includes the version attribute and is defined in
	the common.mod file.
-->
<!ELEMENT opus (title?, (opus | opus-link | score)*)>
<!ATTLIST opus
    %document-attributes;
>	

<!--
	The score elements provide the links to the individual 
	movements. The new-page attribute, added in Version
	2.0, is used to indicate if the first page of the score is 
	different than the last page of the previous score. If
	new-page is "yes", then a different page is used; if
	"no", then the same page is used. The default value is
	implementation-dependent.
-->
<!ELEMENT score EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST score
    %link-attributes;
    new-page %yes-no; #IMPLIED
>

<!--
	An opus-link provides a link to another opus document,
	allowing for multiple levels of opus collections via
	linking as well as nesting.
-->
<!ELEMENT opus-link EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST opus-link %link-attributes;>

<!--
	Future versions may include metadata elements. In
	this version, we just include the title of the opus.
-->
<!ELEMENT title (#PCDATA)>
